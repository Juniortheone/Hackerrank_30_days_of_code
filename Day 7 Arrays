# Note: Python does not have in-built arrays
# Lists are usually used as arrays in Python
# However, if you insist, you can use libraries eg numpy
"""I will start with simple solutions"""

## Case_1 ##
n = int(input())
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4] # assuming this is the list of entered numbers
new = arr[::-1]    # reverse arr and save it as a new list
for ss in new:     # use a for loop to print each element in new
     print(ss, end=" ")
     
## Case_2 ##
# Use the same scenario in Case_1 via a list comprehension
new = [print(ss, end=" ") for ss in arr[::-1]]

## Case_3 ##
# Use the reversed method with
# Unpacking - this is very important
print(*reversed(arr)) # * is used for unpacking
