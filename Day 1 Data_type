"""The variables i, d, and s have been pre-defined"""
# Declaring the variables as per the question
# Note, however, that, in Python a variable is created when you first assign a value to it
# As such, it is not declared. This is in contrast to languages like C++ which needs
# declaration with a type
# Create the variables x, y, and z
x = 0                         # Variable x is initialised with a type value, int
y = 0.0                       # Variable y is initialised with a type value, float or double in some programming languages
z = " "                       # Variable z is initialised with a type value, string
"""Cast the input values with the preferred type"""
x = int(input())
y = float(input())
z = str(input())
"""Print the values"""
print(i + x)
print(d + y)
print(s + z)

"""Possible solutions"""
# Unpack variables directly, and split the values entered
# Note, however, there are three variables. 
# As such, the values entered need to be three
# Anything more or less will generate an error, especially, the string part
# This approach accepts multiple inputs at the same time
x, y, z = input("Enter three values: ").split()
x = int(x)
y = float(y)
z = str(z)
print(i + x)
print(d + y)
print(s + " " + z)
# print(s, z)

# The first can be packed into a function as well
